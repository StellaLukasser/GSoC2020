# GSoC2020
This repository provides a discription as well as links and pictures of my work during Google Summer of Code 2020. 

# My work
Basically, I developed new embroidery designs and implemented them by using the Catrobat programming language, more specifically the Pocket Code respectively the Embroidery Designer App. I exhibited what embroidery designs are feasible to create with the Catrobat visual programming language. Additionally I worked on an algorithm to fill polygons.

Furthermore, I have dealt with the possibilities of integrating electronics, i.e. LEDs or microchips, into an embroidery design.

Some parts of my work i documented on the Catrobat Wiki Page in the form of tutorials or information pages.

These projects include algorithms for special stitches like a grid stitch, which are implemented by just using the stitch brick instead of preprogrammed stitches.

# Work with electronics in combination with embroidery

 On the Catrobat wiki page https://wiki.catrobat.org/bin/view/Education/Embroidery/Special%20Embroidery%20Designs%3A%20Electronics%20to%20shine/ I have documented how to sew LEDs and a coin cell battery onto a design.

Another goal would have been to be able to control the LEDs, which are built into the design, with a microchip. This worked with the Arduino UNO in combination with the Bluetooth module HC-05, but the problem was that this hardware, especially the Arduino UNO, is not sewable. Modern sewable Bluetooth modules all work with Bluetooth Low Energy, but the Embroidery Designer does not support this type of Bluetooth -> Solution: make Embroidery Designer compatible (high effort) or use an old Bluetooth module.

So, I tried to connect the HC-05 Bluetooth module with the Microchips Circuit Playground Classic and Lilypad 328 Main Board. Because the so-called "Old Standard Firmata" has to be used to control the Bluetooth module via the Embroidery Designer/Pocket Code, I loaded it onto the respective microchips. An explenation why this does not work would be work in progress.

# Catrobat Wiki pages I created

Additionally, I created each page in german too. 

# Work in progress

As I have got some hours left, I will create more Embroidery projects as well as a new wiki page, where I will provide a lesson plan for teachers. I will improve the algorithm to automatically fill polygons so that the algorithm will be easy to use for everybody.
